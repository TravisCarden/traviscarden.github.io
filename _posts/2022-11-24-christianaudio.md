description: A few times a year, Christianaudio puts most of their audiobooks on sale for between $6 and $10, providing a great opportunity to stock up on good listens. But the best ones aren't entirely easy to find with the clumsy site search and no category browsing at all. Here are some recommendations to help.

# Puritans and Reformers

## Jeremiah Burroughs

[The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment](https://christianaudio.com/the-rare-jewel-of-christian-contentment-jeremiah-burroughs-audiobook-download) is surely Burroughs' best known work, and it deserves to be. (Too bad Christianaudio doesn't have A Treatise on Earthly-Mindedness or The Evil of Evils.)

[All Jeremiah Burroughs titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Jeremiah%20Burroughs%22)

## John Bunyan

Some believe that Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is the most widely read book in the English language after the Bible. Christianaudio has over a half dozen different versions and readings, including a couple of good abridged and modernized ones for children and young readers.

[All John Bunyan titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20Bunyan%22)

## John Calvin

Calvin's [Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://christianaudio.com/institutes-of-the-christian-religion-john-calvin-audiobook-download) is a historically important work of Protestant theology that's worth the effort to read if you're comfortable with old literature (500 years) and some technical vocabulary. If not, you might want to start with a more modern work, from [R.C. Sproul](#rc-sproul) or [Michael Horton](#michael-horton), for example.

[All John Calvin titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20Calvin%22)

## John Flavel

[Keeping the Heart](https://christianaudio.com/keeping-the-heart-john-flavel-audiobook-download) by John Flavel is a characteristically warm-hearted Puritan treatment of the various seasons and circumstances of life and strategies for keeping your communion with God strong through their varying temptations. 

[All John Flavel titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20Flavel%22)

## John Owen

John Owen competes only with Jonathan Edwards for my favorite theologian. [Of the Mortification of Sin](https://christianaudio.com/of-the-mortification-of-sin-in-believers-john-owen-audiobook-download) was the first Puritan book I ever read, and it changed my life. I essentially learned biblical exegesis from Owen's example.

[All John Owen titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20Owen%22)

## Jonathan Edwards

Jonathan Edwards' [Religious Affections](https://christianaudio.com/the-religious-affections-jonathan-edwards-audiobook-download) is easily one of the five most important books I've ever read--basically the final word on biblical discernment concerning Christian emotions and experiences. I re-read it every year or so.

[All Jonathan Edwards titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Jonathan%20Edwards%22)

## Matthew Henry

While Matthew Henry wrote other excellent books, he's best known for his rich, devotional Bible commentary. Christianaudio has the Concise version in two volumes.

[All Matthew Henry titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Matthew%20Henry%22)

## Richard Sibbes

Richard Sibbes is known for his affecting devotional works. [The Bruised Reed](https://christianaudio.com/the-brusied-reed-richard-sibbes-audiobook-download) is an encouraging exposition of the tenderness of Christ toward His own.

[All Richard Sibbes titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Richard%20Sibbes%22)

## Thomas Boston

[The Crook in the Lot](https://christianaudio.com/crook-in-the-lot-thomas-boston-audiobook-download) treats the wisdom and goodness of God in our trials--a comfort and a help for the suffering.

[All Thomas Boston titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Thomas%20Boston%22)

## Thomas Brooks

[Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices](https://christianaudio.com/precious-remedies-against-satans-devices-thomas-brooks-audiobook-download) is a helpful overview of the ways and times that Satan tends to attack us, with advice for preparing for and escaping him.

[All Thomas Brooks titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Thomas%20Brooks%22)

## Thomas Watson

It's easy to recommend anything Watson wrote. I especially appreciate [All Things for Good](https://christianaudio.com/all-things-for-good-thomas-watson-audiobook-download).

[All Thomas Watson titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Thomas%20Watson%22)

# Classic Authors

## Andrew Murray

My copy of Andrew Murray's little book [Humility](https://christianaudio.com/humility-andrew-murray-audiobook-download) is filled with highlights of rich, memorable lines like, "Just as water always seeks and fills the lowest place, so the moment God finds men abased and empty, His glory and power flow in to exalt and to bless."

[All Andrew Murray titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Andrew%20Murray%22)

## A.W. Pink

A.W. Pink's [The Attributes of God](https://christianaudio.com/the-attributes-of-god-as-pink-audiobook-download) is a classic yet very accessible introduction to the revealed character of God.

[All A.W. Pink titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Arthur%20W.%20Pink%22)

## C.H. Spurgeon

People tend to love Spurgeon for his plain but rich, memorable style. Outside his actual sermons, his [Morning & Evening](https://christianaudio.com/morning-and-evening-ch-spurgeon-audiobook-download-42024) devotional may be his most popular work.

[All C.H. Spurgeon titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Spurgeon%22)

## J. Gresham Machen

As far as I can tell, [Christianity and Liberalism](https://christianaudio.com/christianity-and-liberalism-j-gresham-machen-audiobook-download) is more or less the de facto defense of orthodox Christianity against modern liberal heresy.

[All J. Gresham Machen titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22J.%20Gresham%20Machen%22)

## J.C. Ryle

I find J.C. Ryle refreshingly clear and direct. [Holiness](https://christianaudio.com/holiness-jc-ryle-audiobook-download-42129) is his book to start with.

J.C. Ryle titles: [Part 1](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22J.%20C.%20Ryle%22) & [Part 2](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22J.C.%20Ryle%22).

## John Stott

I would recommend John Stott's [Basic Christianity](https://christianaudio.com/basic-christianity-john-stott-audiobook-download) to _every_ Christian--even (or especially) those young in their faith.

John Stott titles: [Part 1](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20Stott%22) & [Part 2](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20R.W.%20Stott%22).

# Modern Authors

## David Powlison

David Powlison was a man to be imitated as well as read, for his deeply pastoral wisdom and gentleness. (Whether you read his books or not, you should watch or listen to him speak.)

[All David Powlison titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22David%20Powlison%22)

## Donald S. Whitney

Donald Whitney is best known for his work on spiritual disciplines. I've benefited a lot from [Praying the Bible](https://christianaudio.com/praying-the-bible-donald-s-whitney-audiobook-download) and [Family Worship](https://christianaudio.com/family-worship-donald-s-whitney-audiobook-download-36598).

[All Donald S. Whitney titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Donald%20S%20Whitney%22)

## Greg Koukl

Koukl's [Tactics](https://christianaudio.com/tactics-greg-koukl-audiobook-download) is a clear, practical guide to defending the faith.

[All Greg Koukl titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Greg%20Koukl%22)

## Jerry Bridges

Jerry Bridges books seem to become instant small group and Bible study favorites for their combination of depth and readability. [The Pursuit of Holiness](https://christianaudio.com/the-pursuit-of-holiness-jerry-bridges-audiobook-download) and [The Transforming Power of the Gospel](https://christianaudio.com/the-transforming-power-of-the-gospel-jerry-bridges-audiobook-download) stand out as great examples.

[All Jerry Bridges titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Jerry%20Bridges%22)

## J.I. Packer

It would be difficult to praise J.I. Packer's work too highly. It seems like he wrote nothing but classics. [Knowing God](https://christianaudio.com/knowing-god-j-i-packer-audiobook-download) is a great one to start with.

J.I. Packer titles [Part 1](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22J.I.%20Packer%22) & [Part 2](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22J.%20I.%20Packer%22).

## John MacArthur

Most of John MacArthur's books come straight from sermon series. So if you appreciate his plain, faithful, exegetical teaching, you're bound to like his books. Christianaudio doesn't have many of the titles I would have thought of as his quintessentials. Of those they do have, [The Gospel According to God](https://christianaudio.com/the-gospel-according-to-god-john-macarthur-audiobook-download) might be a good one to begin with.

[All John MacArthur titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22John%20MacArthur%22)

## Ken Sande

Ken Sande's [The Peacemaker](https://christianaudio.com/the-peacemaker-ken-sande-audiobook-download) is the best book I know of on the subject of creating and keeping peace in your relationships. It's another of the few books I consider "required" reading. (Younger readers might prefer the shorter [Resolving Everyday Conflict](https://christianaudio.com/resolving-everyday-conflicts-ken-sande-kevin-johnson-audiobook-download), which is basically just an abridgment of it.)

[All Ken Sande titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Ken%20Sande%22)

## Kevin DeYoung

Kevin DeYoung's [What Does the Bible Really Teach About Homosexuality?](https://christianaudio.com/what-does-the-bible-really-teach-about-homosexuality) is a helpful little book on a very timely subject.

[All Kevin DeYoung titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Kevin%20DeYoung%22)

## Michael Horton

Michael Horton's [Ordinary](https://christianaudio.com/ordinary-michael-horton-audiobook-download-40124) will be a breath of fresh air if you're worn out trying to be "radical" or "extreme" enough as a Christian. [Pilgrim Theology](https://christianaudio.com/pilgrim-theology-michael-s-horton-audiobook-download) is a pretty readable systematic theology.

Michael Horton titles [Part 1](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Michael%20Horton%22) & [Part 2](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Michael%20S.%20Horton%22).

## Nancy Pearcey

I consider [Total Truth](https://christianaudio.com/total-truth-nancy-pearcey-audiobook-download) a must for understanding the "spirit of the age" and engaging with the assumed beliefs and ideas that "set themselves up against the knowledge of God" in our generation. Eye-opening. It's in a category all its own.

[All Nancy Pearcey titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Pearcey%22)

## Paul David Tripp

Paul Tripp writes as a pastor/counselor with particular insight in the areas of relationships and communication. [Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands](https://christianaudio.com/instruments-redeemers-hands-paul-david-tripp-audiobook-download) is a classic.

[All Paul David Tripp titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Tripp%22)

## R. Kent Hughes

R. Kent Hughes and his wife Barbara are known for [Disciplines of a Godly Man](https://christianaudio.com/disciplines-of-a-godly-man-r-kent-hughes-audiobook-download) and [Disciplines of a Godly Woman](https://christianaudio.com/disciplines-of-a-godly-woman-barbara-hughes-audiobook-download), respectively. I've read one of them. ;)

[All R. Kent Hughes titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22R.%20Kent%20Hughes%22)

## R.C. Sproul

It's easy for me to recommend R.C. Sproul. It's hard to choose just a few titles to mention, Christianaudio has so many! [The Holiness of God](https://christianaudio.com/the-holiness-of-god-rc-sproul-audiobook-download) is a modern classic, followed shortly by [The Work of Christ](https://christianaudio.com/the-work-of-christ-r-c-sproul-christianaudio-audiobook-download). I definitely recommend [Knowing Scripture](https://christianaudio.com/knowing-scripture-rc-sproul-audiobook-download). [Essential Truths of the Christian Faith](https://christianaudio.com/essential-truths-of-the-christian-faith-rc-sproul-audiobook-download) is a basic overview of theology that would be well-suited to new Christians or younger readers (say, teens). [Foundations](https://christianaudio.com/foundations-rc-sproul-audiobook-download) is a full systematic theology.

[All R.C. Sproul titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22R.C.%20Sproul%22)

# Historians and Biographers

## Corrie ten Boom

[The Hiding Place](https://christianaudio.com/the-hiding-place-corrie-ten-boom-with-john-elizabeth-sherrill-audiobook-download) is one of my favorite biographies of all time, the moving and challenging memoir of a woman who helped Jews escape Nazi Germany and then lived through a concentration camp herself.

[All Corrie ten Boom titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Corrie%20ten%20Boom%22)

## Eric Metaxas

Metaxas' [Bonhoeffer](https://christianaudio.com/bonhoeffer-eric-metaxas-audiobook-download) tells the incredible true story of the German Lutheran pastor, theologian, and anti-Nazi dissident.

[All Eric Metaxas titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Eric%20Metaxas%22)

## Michael Reeves

Reeves is a good church historian and an insightful cultural critic, too.

[All Michael Reeves titles.](https://christianaudio.com/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?author=%22Michael%20Reeves%22)
