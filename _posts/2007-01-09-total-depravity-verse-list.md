The doctrine of total depravity (or total inability) says that all men, as a consequence of the Fall, are born morally corrupt, enslaved to sin, at enmity with God, and unable to please Him or even of themselves to turn to Christ for salvation. (Thus the necessity of a gracious, unconditional election.) Here is a sweeping survey of the biblical support for the doctrine.

## Is man basically good or basically evil?

- **Ecclesiastes 7:29** - "See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, _but_ they have sought out many schemes."
- **Romans 5:7-8** - For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—_but God shows his love for us_ in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
- **Romans 5:12,19** - sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned... by the one man’s disobedience the many were made _sinners_

c.f. Job 15:14-16, 25:4-6; Ecclesiastes 9:3

## All men? Are there any exceptions?

- **Psalm 143:2** - Enter not into judgment with your servant, for _no one living is righteous before you_.
- **Romans 11:32** - For God has consigned _all_ to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. (c.f. Galatians 3:22)
- **Romans 3:23** - for _all have sinned_ and fall short of the glory of God
- **2 Chronicles 6:36** - "there is no one who does not sin"
- **Isaiah 53:6** - _All we_ like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—_every one_—to his own way
- **Micah 7:2-4** - The godly has perished from the earth, and _there is no one upright among mankind_; they all lie in wait for blood, and each hunts the other with a net. Their hands are on what is evil, to do it well; the prince and the judge ask for a bribe, and the great man utters the evil desire of his soul; thus they weave it together. _The best of them is like a brier, the most upright of them a thorn hedge._
- **Romans 3:9-12** - What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written: “_None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one._” (c.f. Psalm 14:1-3, 53:1-3)
- **1 John 1:8,10** - If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we say we have not sinned, we make [God] a liar, and his word is not in us.

## Are people good deep down?

- **Mark 7:21-23** - "For _from within, out of the heart of man_, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. _All these evil things come from within_, and they defile a person." (c.f. Matthew 15:19)
- **Psalm 5:9** - For there is no truth in their mouth; _their inmost self is destruction;_ their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.

## Are men _totally_ depraved? Is _every_ faculty of the person corrupted?

### Heart/Mind (Deceitful)

- **Jeremiah 17:9** - "_The heart is deceitful above all things_, and desperately sick; who can understand it?"
- **Titus 1:15-16** - to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but _both their minds and their consciences are defiled_.
- **Ecclesiastes 9:3** - Also, the hearts of the children of man are _full of evil, and madness is in their hearts_ while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
- **Romans 1:28-31** - And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, _God gave them up to a debased mind_ to do what ought not to be done. They were... _foolish_
- **Ephesians 4:17-18** - you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in _the futility of their minds_. They are _darkened in their understanding_, alienated from the life of God because of the _ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart_.
- **Jeremiah 10:7-8,14** - among all the wise ones of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like you. _They are both stupid and foolish... Every man is stupid and without knowledge_
- **Matthew 15:19** - "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander." (c.f. Mark 7:21-23)
- **Genesis 6:5 & 8:21** - The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that _every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually... from his youth._
- **Proverbs 10:20** - the heart of the wicked is of little worth.
- **Proverbs 28:26** - Whoever trusts in his own [heart] is a fool

c.f. Deuteronomy 29:2-4; Psalm 10:4, 36:1-2, 58:4-5, 94:11; Proverbs 10:20; Ecclesiastes 8:11; Ezekiel 11:19, 36:26; Matthew 13:14; Mark 7:21-23; Romans 8:7; Ephesians 4:17-18, 23

### Will/Choosing (Enslaved)

- **John 8:34** - Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a _slave to sin_."
- **2 Peter 2:19** - They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is _enslaved_.
- **Titus 3:3** - For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, _slaves to various passions and pleasures_, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
- **Galatians 4:8-9** - Formerly, when you did not know God, _you were enslaved_ to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose _slaves_ you want to be once more?
- **Romans 6:6,16,17,19,20** - We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be _enslaved to sin_. Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, _you are slaves of the one whom you obey_...? But thanks be to God, that you who were once _slaves of sin_ have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed... For just as you once presented your members as _slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness_, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. _For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness._
- **Romans 7:14** - For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, _sold under sin_.
- **2 Timothy 2:25-26** - God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after _being captured by him to do his will_.

c.f. Isaiah 42:6-7; Psalm 51:12; John 8:31-32,36; 2 Corinthians 3:17

### Affections/Desires (Perverted)

- **Romans 1:24-27** - Therefore _God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity_, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. For this reason _God gave them up to dishonorable passions_. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
- **Ephesians 2:3** - we all once lived _in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind_, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.<span style="font-style: italic;">

- **Romans 7:18** - For I know that _nothing good dwells in me_, that is, in my flesh.

## Can men change themselves or still do good when they want to?

- **Jeremiah 13:23** - Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.

- **Matthew 12:34-35** - "How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and _the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil_."
- **Romans 8:7** - For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for _it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot_.
- **Genesis 6:5 & 8:21** - The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that _every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually... from youth._
- **Titus 1:15-16** - to the defiled and unbelieving, _nothing is pure_; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, _unfit for any good work_.

c.f. Job 14:4; Matthew 12:34; John 15:5; Romans 14:23; Philippians 1:11; 1 John 5:18-19

- **Genesis 8:21** - the Lord said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for _the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth_.<span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span>

## What is man's relationship _to_ God?

- **Psalm 58:3** - The wicked are _estranged_ from the womb;
- **Ephesians 2:12-13** - remember that you were at that time _separated_ from Christ, _alienated_ from the commonwealth of Israel and _strangers_ to the covenants of promise, having no hope and _without God_ in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were _far off_ have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

## Can the natural man comprehend the gospel or come to saving knowledge of God on his own?

- **2 Corinthians 4:3-4** - _our gospel is veiled... to those who are perishing._ In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
- **1 Corinthians 1:18,21-24** - For the word of the cross is _folly_ to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For since, in the wisdom of God, the world _did not know God_ through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, _a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles_
- **Deuteronomy 29:2-4** - And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: "You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land, the great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.

- **John 14:16-17** - "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, _whom the world cannot receive_, because it neither sees him nor knows him."

- **Philippians 1:29** - For _it has been granted to you_ that for the sake of Christ you should... believe in him
- **Acts 18:27** - When he arrived, he greatly helped those _who through grace had believed_
