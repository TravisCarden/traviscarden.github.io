* [The Tale of Two Sons by John MacArthur](https://www.gty.org/library/topical-series-library/294/the-tale-of-two-sons) (series) - Movingly portrays the heart of God as lavishly gracious and loving toward undeserving sinners through a fresh examination of the Parable of the Prodigal Son.
* [This Man Went Down to His House Justified by John Piper](https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/this-man-went-down-to-his-house-justified) - Expounds righteousness in Christ from the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector.

# Podcasts

* [The Briefing with Albert Mohler](https://www.sbts.edu/briefing/) - "A daily analysis of news and events from a Christian worldview." It's the only podcast I listen to every day.
* [Behold Your God from Media Gratiae](https://www.mediagratiae.org/blog/category/Behold+Your+God+Podcast) - A regular discussion of theology with a particular emphasis on personal application. It's very good at introducing subjects that may seem difficult and making them practical and accessible. I like learning about historical theology and sampling the thought and writings of godly men of the past. One of my favorites.
