# Podcasts

* [The Briefing with Albert Mohler](https://www.sbts.edu/briefing/) - "A daily analysis of news and events from a Christian worldview." The only podcast I listen to daily.
* [Behold Your God from Media Gratiae](https://www.mediagratiae.org/blog/category/Behold+Your+God+Podcast) - A regular discussion of theology with a particular emphasis on personal application. It's very good at introducing subjects that may seem difficult and making them practical and accessible. I like learning about historical theology and sampling the thought and writings of godly men of the past. One of my favorites.
