Omaha Bible Church (OBC), in Omaha, Nebraska, is an independent Bible church with roots in religious fundamentalism and with strong legalistic tendencies. It is generally within the pale of Protestant orthodoxy, but it has a problem with an angry spirit and abusive leaders. The following review is based on about eight years of personal experience (ending in 2015) and organized around the [9 Marks of a Healthy Church](https://9marks.org/about/).

**Note:** As this is a critical review, I wish to clarify up-front that it refers to OBC _as a ministry_ and is not directed at any of the fine people who attend there.

# Preaching

Sermons at OBC tend to be of a good length, center on Scripture, and emphasize truth. Notwithstanding these things (which are good so far as they go), a number of characteristics of the preaching at OBC render it, in my judgment, something between unedifying and positively toxic. Two stand out:

1. **Irreverence and inappropriate speech.** It should go without saying that the pulpit ought to be characterized by purity of speech, and to imagine that one should have to warn one's children not to imitate the behavior of one's own pastor there is absurd; but it came to that for me at OBC. I have heard the senior pastor from the pulpit call Mormons and Roman Catholics "stupid", refer to historical church figures with whom he disagrees as "sissies", joke about certain people in the church being ugly, and quip that he is "a lesbian trapped in a man's body". I need not defend my mention of these sayings since they are published in the public sermon archive where anyone on the Internet may listen to them under the banner of "the Word of the Lord".

1. **Distorted, hobby horse preaching.** In my experience, the preaching at OBC consistently misrepresents the content, emphasis, and tone of Scripture. There are a handful of major themes (mostly "liberal correctives") which seem to feature in every sermon whether they're in the text or not, while the real biblical message receives little or no treatment. The tone of the preaching is more often sarcastic and condescending than anything else. (The pastors argue that scripture itself is sarcastic. And sometimes it is, of course--but not always, about everything, and to every audience, whereas OBC's preaching more or less is.) In general, the preaching seems to be shaped more by the pastor's personality than by the Word, and the God thus portrayed is something of a caricature as a result.

In summary, I believe that while the preaching at OBC has some admirable qualities, its defects render it on the whole dishonoring to God and harmful to its hearers.

# Leadership

OBC's leaders give every appearance of caring deeply about their church, and they clearly work hard in their roles. They seem, however, to misunderstand the nature of their authority, which they tend to lord over tender souls in their care. They are friendly people in general, but when it comes to shepherding, they tend to be impatient, controlling, and intolerant of dissent. I would go so far as to say that some of the pastors can be abusive. Worst of all, they altogether lack biblical accountability. They are self-protective to the extent that I have known them to collectively flout Matthew 18 when applied to one of themselves. They seem to me not to be above reproach so much as above the law.

# Discipline

The best thing I can say of OBC relative to church discipline is that they attempt to practice it at all--which, in an age of individualism that chafes at any hint of accountability, is saying _something_. Nevertheless, they pervert the practice so entirely that I'm afraid it might have been the lesser evil to have omitted it altogether. From disciplining where they acknowledge there has been no sin, to disciplining preemptively or retributively, to skipping whole steps of the Matthew 18 process, to refusing eventual reconciliation, to exempting pastors from accountability to the same process, and more, they have not failed in very many particulars to mock the biblical practice. The leaders have declined to discuss these matters when confronted. Suffice it to say that it is a point of unrepentant corporate sin.

# Coming upâ€¦

Biblical theology, the gospel, conversion, evangelism, membership, and discipleship, as I get to them.
